### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Rachael Smith
#### Data Scientist and AI/ML Optimist

During my undergrad at BYU Idaho, I focused on taking every class available to prepare me for a career in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AI/ML); including deep learning, linear algebra, discrete math, big data, and linear regression. My interests include data visualization, working with complex data, asking questions about my data to better understand how it can be used and what's missing, data bias, and feature engineering for machine learning algorithms. My passion is helping use data to drive decisions and building tools to streamline data collection and maximize automation to provide better insight capabilities with less upfront effort. When I run a feature importance chart on my model, nothing makes me more excited than seeing a feature that I envisioned influences the predictive capabilities of the model.
